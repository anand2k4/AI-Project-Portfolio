# Rule-Based Sentiment Analyzer

## 📌 Project Overview
A basic sentiment classification system that categorizes movie reviews as positive or negative using keyword matching.

## 🧠 Problem It Solves
Simulates early-stage AI text labeling systems used in NLP training pipelines.

## ⚙️ How It Works
- Stores reviews in a list
- Converts text to lowercase
- Matches predefined positive/negative keywords
- Counts category totals

## 🛠 Skills Demonstrated
- Lists and Loops
- String Processing
- Keyword-Based Classification
- Basic Data Analysis

## 📊 Output Example

Total Reviews: 15  
Positive Reviews: 8  
Negative Reviews: 7

## Limitations

Does not understand context

Cannot detect sarcasm

Based only on keyword matching

Example: Notice this review:

"Not good at all"

It contains the word "good".

Your system will classify it as positive ❌
But logically it is negative.
